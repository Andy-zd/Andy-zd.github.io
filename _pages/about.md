Iâ€™m currently a second-year M.S. student at Fudan University. My recent work lies in computer vision, including 3D reconstruction and simulation. My interests include 3D vision and gernerative models.

Previously, I got my bachelor degree at School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University in June 2021.
