  Iâ€™m currently a third-year M.S. student in Fudan University, supervised by Weiguo Gao. I worked as a research assistant in [Zhang Vision Group](https://fudan-zvg.github.io/), supervised by [Feihu Zhang](http://www.feihuzhang.com/) and [Li Zhang](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~lz/). I also spent four months as a visiting graduate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, under the supervision of [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/). Previously, I got my bachelor degree in School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University in June 2021.   

  My recent work lies in computer vision, including 3D reconstruction, simulation and generative models. My interests include generative models, and 3D vision.
