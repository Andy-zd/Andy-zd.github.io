  Iâ€™m currently a second-year M.S. student in Fudan University, working in Zhang Vision Group, supervised by [Feihu Zhang](http://www.feihuzhang.com/) and [Li Zhang](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~lz/). My recent work lies in computer vision, including 3D reconstruction, simulation and generative models. My interests include 3D vision, gernerative models and pattern recognition.

  Previously, I got my bachelor degree in School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University in June 2021.
