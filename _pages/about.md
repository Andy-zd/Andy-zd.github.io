  Iâ€™m currently a first-year PhD student at University of California, Riverside, supervised by [Jiachen Li](https://jiachenli94.github.io/). I worked as a research assistant in [Zhang Vision Group](https://fudan-zvg.github.io/) during my master career. I also spent four months as a visiting graduate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, under the supervision of [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree in School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University in 2021 and 2024 respectively.   

  My current interests include robotics, generative models, and 3D vision. And I believe Sim-to-Real is the way to intelligent agents.
